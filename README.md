This repository contains an example of an uncommon ActionScript 3 bug related to XML parsing. The bug occurs when the code attempts to access XML nodes that may not exist due to variations in XML structure or missing elements.  The solution demonstrates how to robustly handle such scenarios using error checking and conditional logic.  The bug and solution files illustrate the problem and its resolution using ActionScript 3.
